My name is Connor Briggs, and I am interested in \{program\} at \{school\}. I have always been interested in chemistry, and I recently graduated from Virginia Tech with a B.S. in chemistry with a math minor. My love for chemistry has been driven by my desire to learn and discover new science.

While I was at Virginia Tech, I participated in undergraduate research with Dr. Daniel Crawford's quantum chemistry group, and Dr. Joseph Merola's inorganic chemistry group. With Dr. Crawford, I studied machine learning and quantum chemistry. With Dr. Merola, I investigated ring-opening reactions between an iridium complex and several substituted thiophenes. I hope to continue research at a higher level, and I believe my previous experience will prove usefull to the research at \{school\}. 

During my time at Virginia Tech, I struggled with my GPA. Getting adjusted to college in my first semester was difficult, and resulted in receiving a low GPA. This low first semester has been a drain on my GPA, which is why it is only a 2.75 overall. As a better reflection of my abilities, my GRE scores were well above average in the general and chemistry subject tests. My transcript also shows my improvement after my freshman year, with a steady increase in the grade averages each semester.

Conclusion?
