\section{Statement}
Chemistry graduate from Virginia Tech with five years research experience. Motivated to learn. Strong attention to detail, and always with a positive attitude. Energetic personality. My documentation skills are strong from my background in computer programming. Work well in team oriented settings. Self-motivated and good at multi-tasking.

\section{Education}
\cventry{08/2017 - 05/2022}{B.S. in Chemistry, Mathematics Minor}{Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech)}{Blacksburg, VA, 24060}{GPA: 2.75}{Completed a bachelor's degree in chemistry. While taking classes, I also worked with Dr. Daniel Crawford's research group, where I contributed to the publication of one paper, and wrote thousands of lines of code. I also learned the importance of confidentiality in the sciences.}
