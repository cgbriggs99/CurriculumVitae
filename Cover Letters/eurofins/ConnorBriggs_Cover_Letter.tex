  \opening{Dear Recruiter}

   My name is Connor Briggs, and I am interested in applying to be a data review scientist with your company. I am a recent chemistry graduate from Virginia Tech, and am looking to apply my skills in the real world. I already have much experience working in a lab setting from my time at Virginia Tech, and also from continuing research after graduation with Dr. Joseph Merola's lab. Over the course of my degree, I also worked with Dr. Daniel Crawford's lab to co-author a paper on quantum chemistry.
  
  
  My experience in chemistry gives me a unique edge when it comes to analyzing a variety of data. I applied these analysis skills in my research with Dr. Merola, where I needed to assess the purity, identity, and structure of synthesized compounds; and in my research with Dr. Crawford, where I undertook problems involving data mining and machine learning, and applying these techniques to quantum chemistry. My degree and research gave me experience in many common data analysis tools, especially Microsoft Office.


  Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. I hope my skills and experiences will be a good fit for the Lancaster team. I look forward to hearing a response.
  
\closing{Sincerely,}
